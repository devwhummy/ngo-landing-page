          <p>
            When you donate money for programs that help the working poor make
            their way out of poverty, you are helping to create a population
            within your community that is stronger. In general, your community
            is only as strong as your weakest members. When more pweople are
            able to live a better life because they no longer have to struggle
            every day, your community is going to improve.

          <h3>Why you should donate</h3>
          <p>
            Sharing the experience of donating to charity with your children
            shows them from a young age that they can make positive changes in
            the world. Children naturally love to help others, so nurturing
            their innate genorosity is likely to mean that they grow up with a
            greater appeciation of what they have. and will carry on supporting
            charity in years to come.
